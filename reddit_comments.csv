0;"Idk what ya’ll are mad about. I’m pretty excited for Beren: Next Generations.

"
1;"Can't wait to see a crippled Levi fighting dinosaurs. (They're previous Beast Titan iterations)

"
2;"Can't wait for when Bellen Kristein would fight Jack ""Uncle Jack"" Forrester

"
3;"Honestly speaking I wouldn't mind reading it (beren the next generations)

"
4;"Beren is stunning, the ending is bad.
Reasons: alliance defeats all the ancient titans, like they were pockemons. Dialogues are stupid, Eren’s speech “I don’t know what the hell i was doing” is confusing, “it all was for Mikasa to make her choice” is confusing again. Finally, Armin’s words “they will see us together and would want to hear our story” are too naive for all the AoT journey.
Long story short - the ending is bad cause it is too childish for the show we were watching for ten years at least

"
5;"I lost it at ""for ten years at least"" 😂😂😂

"
6;"Yeah this was the big one for me. The Alliance suffering basically zero consequences for their actions was utterly ridiculous, especially in a show that made its mark by having characters actually be able to die at any time.

"
7;"I’m dying 🤣 but I’d totally be down.

"
8;"i neither love it like ending defenders nor hate it like titanfolkers 
to me its an average and predictable ending but it doesnt ruin the entire show for me like the yeagerist say
people were expecting something flabbergasting like some of the previous plot twists in the series
my only problem is that by destroying paradise in the end gave some people an excuse that genocide was the only option
if i could change one thing from ending i wouldve made sure that someone out of armin reiner and the others become the new ""Helos"" Or the new ""Tyburs""
but unlike the tyburs who ruined everything the new tyburs(armin or reiner) will help paradise reconcile with rotr
this way the 20 percent of the humanity and paradise could've had a somewhat happy ending and it wouldve given a good message

"
9;"
my only problem is that by destroying paradise in the end gave some people an excuse that genocide was the only option

Lol if that didn't happen then they would say ""see! Eren's genocide saved the island forever!""
You can draw out any conclusion you want from anything, the story put those panels after generations and out of context so people wouldn't assume anything specific but understand it is supposed to be a general representation of human hate and greed, so basically you can conclude Armin and the rest did keep a peaceful relationship for a temporary time

"
10;"
Lol if that didn't happen then they would say ""see! Eren's genocide saved the island forever!""

OHHHHH , point .

"
11;"All I got from the ending is that they should have rumbled everyone to dust. Of course if you leave the stragglers with intact militaries they're going to come back as soon as they can and bomb them. Man that ending really wasn't good

"
12;"That’s because you share yeagerist beliefs unfortunately. It demonstrated the cycle of hate. Even after generations of peace, humans will still continue to their violent behavior. Those who wanted everything rumbled to dust just like a good ol’ tragic ending. God knows I do lol 😆

"
13;"But what was the alternative? Without rumbling they would have been wiped out much sooner

"
14;"Exactly. Anything to fit their narrative. Eren wins? The yeagerists were right. Eren loses? The yeagerists were right. They just want feel right, not actually understand the message of the story

"
15;"In the story presented they were right tho. Break the chain of hatred by getting rid of all of the hatred simple.

"
16;"Considering the destruction of paradise was like a century later, I always find it pretty disingenuous when people talk like it had anything to do with racism.

"
17;"It was way too rushed that was it’s issue. Along with some terrible dialogue at some points.

"
18;"Firstly, if you enjoyed the ending, that's great. You don't need to love/hate it just because someone else thinks you should, but +1 for being open to discussing it.
That said here's the reasons. Covers the tl;dr for most major issues people have:

Ymir loving King Fritz is nuts unless we're meant to believe she's got Stockholm syndrome. Ch. 123 made it clear her motivations were to be free from being a slave, so where did this ""discovering love through Mikasa"" nonesense come from?
Eren responsible for his mother's death is a plot hole that added nothing to the story.
Connie/Jean's titan transformation/death turned out to be just suspense/drama bait as the consequences were immediately undone.
Eren's best reasoning for the rumbling is ""I don't know"", which undermines his character/motivations. Eg Eren's  repeatedly established ""keep moving forward until all my enemies are destroyed"", but that's been thrown out and now he doesn't know?
Armin's ""we're not titans anymore, trust me bro"" is shallow and half-baked. It's not the kind of thing you can slap onto one panel and call it good.
The alliance's blatant plot armor was through the roof. Kills any suspension of disbelief.
Historia seemingly was retconned out the story. What was the point of her child?
Eren rumbles 80% of the world and, of all things, his primary concern is about Mikasa finding another man. Selfish and childish. Where did this plot thread even come from?
The rumbling amounted to nothing, Paradis got bombed anyways. 50 year plan could've had the exact same outcome but without risking everyone's lives.
The open ending ""Beren next generations"" could've been presented better.
Reiner letter-sniffing was funny, but it's a symptom of a more major problem which is that we got no real conclusion for most of the main cast and their plot threads. What happened to Reiner, Annie, Historia? Who knows, but at least Reiner's the big Historia simp, right??


"
19;"Regarding Ymir loving king Fritz i believe that she could not Escape the psychological prison of being a slave and thus as you said, got Stockholm syndrome, because technically as the mother of titans she could just have ripped him apart and even take the throne. It reminds me of these elephant in circus and Asia, they are attached with a very light rope that they could escape easily from , but they've grown up seeing it as a tool binding them.
For paradis bombing it's quite clear it's decades if not Centuries after, so it's just a message that anyway war never dies.

"
20;"The Stockholm syndrome makes complete sense but at the same time is entirely headcannon. If it was confirmed as cannon it would still be terrible because there was no development of such a big twist.

"
21;"It’s not a headcanon. You can infer it from the information Isayama has given us.
A good writer won’t insult the intelligence of their readers by explaining in detail every little message they’re trying to impart. We know Ymir had a stockholm-esque love for Fritz because 1) she envied the married couple, 2) Mikasa’s devotion to Eren foiling her own devotion to Fritz, 3) serving him as a slave even when she had all that power.
There’s no way to “develop” Ymir’s “love” without killing the mystery factor surrounding her life, or again, insulting the intelligence of the readers. All the “development” we needed was shown through Mikasa and Ymir’s flashback.

"
22;"Ymir is in an abusive relationship, and her behavior is of an abused woman. She rightiously begrudges king Fritz, but cannot let him go either. She is trauma bonded and believes this feeling is love because she does not know any better. Until she sees what Mikasa does to Eren, of course, and learns the difference between true love and toxic dependency that refuses to let go. 
Thi part of the ending, i.e. the motivations involved , makes a lot of sense to me and I personally find it quite a beautiful exploration of abuse, trauma, and love.

"
23;"Yes, I wholeheartedly agree.  I also agree with most of u/lankyseat’s critique.  The final arc has its hits and its misses.

"
24;"I agree. I get a lot of people may have not picked up on it at first, but it makes perfect sense when you really think about it the lives of Mikasa and Ymir respectively, their mindsets, and how they ultimately chose to approach the person they loved.

"
25;"Most things you bring up are easily refuted/explained. I know people hate hearing this, but imo a lot of these points seem to result either from nitpicking or failing to pick up on certain things the story presents. And I don't say that to be an asshole.

Ymir loving Fritz is as ""nuts"" as it is for any victim to love their abuser. When you're alone, beaten into believing you have no value, cursed with a slave's mindset, and desperate for love, you're gonna take that love no matter who offers it to you.


Maybe it doesn't make sense to you, but I'm sure plenty of abuse victims can relate to ""loving"" an abuser while in a state of loneliness and desperation, and doing awful things on their behalf due to that manipulation.
Ymir freeing the pigs was a spontaneous action of free will, just as was her initiation of the rumbling and her choosing to die. Each time she reverted back to a slave immediately after. She wants to be free but she never had the strength to fully pursue that desire.
Mikasa freed Ymir because Mikasa showed someone that you could dedicate your life to someone you love and still not be a slave to them in the end. Mikasa dedicated herself to protecting Eren not because she was a slave, but because she CHOSE to, just as she CHOSE to stop protecting him when it came down to it. Mikasa had more freedom than Eren or Ymir because she chose to uphold her values and never disregard them, even for someone she loved. Her actions showed Ymir she would've been better off simply living with her three daughters, who she genuinely loved even if they were born of a twisted ""love""

Carla's death is not a plot hole. He used the FT while in the time-fucked realm of Paths to make Dina skip Bert, and push his past self to the path he needed to be on. It's really no different to what he did with Grisha, and nobody complains about that being a plot hole. And it added to the story by showing how Eren has been a slave to his own wants and desires since he was a kid.
I agree. Connie/Jean coming back is kind of corny. But not so bad I feel it should contribute to hate against the ending.
Eren didn't literally mean he had no clue what he was doing. Look at the panel as he said that. He wanted to do it because it's intrinsic to his nature. Because he was born in this world. He wanted and had to do the Rumbling.


Even if he didn't know it undermines nothing. Yeah, he keeps moving forward. Doesn't necessarily means he has to know why. If I follow a compulsion to do something but don't know why that doesn't change the fact I feel and follow that compulsion.

Armin's statement about not being titans is not shallow at all. 1) It parallels him defending Eren from the Garrison in season one, 2) If you just saw the massive titan worm die, Founding/Attack-Colossal Titan die, and every Titan revert it's not too hard to believe that the Titan powers have ended. The Marleyan commander was scared at first yes, but remembered his promise to never repeat the same mistakes, and thus didn't kill the Eldians
Historia was not ""retconned"". Her arc was over, she had to rule Paradis so it's not like she'd be involved in the fight, and her child was to keep Zeke from being turned into a titan


The definition of a retcon is ""described events contradicting previously described events"". That term doesn't even apply here, but I get what you mean

Eren is literally having a mental breakdown when he cries. He's losing his love, is friends, his mind, and soon his life. Surely you can why he's freaking out over ""petty"" matters like that.


This happens before he even completed the Rumbling

Multiple responses to the point that the Rumbling amounted to nothing:


Good. Violence amounts to nothing. That's the lesson here. The Rumbling didn't ""solve"" anything in the grand scheme of things because pure, hate-filled violence rarely does.


And anyways, it granted his surviving friends longer lives, which was enough to satisfy him at least a little

Even if it succeeded, Paradis would simply turn on itself, as what happened to the Eldian Empire in the past, and as Kiyomi explained
By that logic, nothing ever amounts to nothing because one day everything will end. My guy, everything ends. Just because Eren didn't complete the rumbling doesn't mean Paradis would last forever, and there was no way he could magically preserve Paradis forever.

Eren is a psycho who wanted to destroy the world entirely. He wasn't operating on what was the best plan, he was operating on his desire to turn the outside world into a blank canvas, as the S4P2 ED and his own words reinforce.


It was a 50 year plan. Not a 5 year plan

How could the open ending have been presented better than how it was. Nature of the war is left ambiguous, kid traverses the ruins, and discovers a large tree arising from Eren's grave - it all nods to the recurrent cyclic themes presented in the story, while not telling us exactly what's going on for mystery factor.
We do get a conclusion for all of the characters. We don't need a montage of their lives to figure that out


Levi, Onyankopon, Gabi, and Falco live the rest of their lives in peace, presumably in the same locale
Reiner, Annie, Pieck, Jean, Armin, and Connie work to try and forge peace between the outside world and Paradis. While it clearly wasn't as successful as they would've wanted, the peace likely lasts over a century based on the architecture and tree size we see in the extra pages.


Mikasa presumably helps in these efforts but likely retires for the most part

Historia rules over Paradis, trying to placate the Yeagerists while also avoiding large-scale conflict


Also, I think a big factor people are upset is because Eren didn't win. Some people really are just that simple.

"
26;"
imo a lot of these points seem to result either from nitpicking or failing to pick up on certain things the story presents

This is just a derivative of the ""you didn't understand the story"", which is outlandish. Much of AOT, including most of my points, can be left up to interpretation ie ""certain things"" probably aren't that cut and dry.

Maybe it doesn't make sense to you, but I'm sure plenty of abuse victims can relate

The issue is not that Ymir can't possibly have Stockholm syndrome, because, as absurd as it is, I see the argument for it.
The issue is that there was no indication Ymir's story was about Stockholm syndrome prior to 139 ie the Stockholm syndrome plotline was shoved into the story at the last minute, rewriting everything which was established about Ymir.

Ymir freeing the pigs was a spontaneous action of free will

There's no basis for this claim. It was never implicitly or explicitly stated that Ymir's actions were simply that of ""spontaneous actions of free will"".

It's really no different to what he did with Grisha

Not true. Eren's power could only influence the memories of prior Attack titans. It wasn't until 139 that it was revealed he could control titans as well. What he did with Grisha was significantly different.

But not so bad I feel it should contribute to hate against the ending.

It's like if after Levi revived Armin, Erwin got up and said ""tis but a scratch"". Ruins the impact of the event and is a disservice to the story's focus on sacrifice.
No realized consequences in the story makes AOT feel like a Marvel movie instead of AOT.

Yeah, he keeps moving forward. Doesn't necessarily means he has to know why.

It was never ""compulsion"". Eren's intentions are made clear even before time skip. Destroy all his enemies(90). Protect the people of Paradise(123). To be free, not a slave(112). There is no inconsistency with this pre or post time skip, these ideas are reinforced throughout.
So sitching to ""compulsion"" absolutely does undermine his character, as it goes against everything the story has told us about Eren's motives and intent.

Armin's statement about not being titans is not shallow at all

To clarify:
You can't take 2000 years of conflict and wrap it up in two panels with ""I killed Eren, trust me bro we're cool now"". This conclusion needed way more time, as I can boil the interaction down to as little as ""trust me bro"", which is why it's so shallow.
Bummer, because this could otherwise have been a masterful moment where AOT's conflict comes to a head.

Her arc was over

This is up to interpretation. You could blame my interpretation if you want, but that said it was a common interpretation.
Eren/Historia's convo being a memory shared. The final panel dropping around the same time. The random panels of pregnant Historia during the rumbling. There's too much for me to accept that Isayama's OG plan really was nothing, ie there's no way that Historia's ""arc was over"".
If so, why waste all that story time on Historia having a child? As the story stands, you can take pregnant Historia out of the picture and the story will be unchanged.

He's losing his love, is friends, his mind, and soon his life.

But that is not why he broke down.
He did not say ""I'm about to lose my friends, I don't want that!"" instead he so eloquently said ""Mikasa finding another man, I don't want that!"".

Good. Violence amounts to nothing. That's the lesson here.

If that's all AOT boils down to, that is an unsatisfactory conclusion and a complete underutilization of a story with such well-established themes like the cycle of hatred, discriminations, and sacrifice.
""Thanks Isayama! Now I know violence/genocide is bad!""
Instead of a chapter showcasing the horrors of a post-rumbling world eg economies falling, retaliatory escalation of discrimination, societal/emotional scarring, etc, we got Paradise being bombed XXX years in the future and our characters live happily ever after. Absolutely nothing.

Just because Eren didn't complete the rumbling doesn't mean Paradis would last forever

Whoever said this is what we wanted?

It was a 50 year plan. Not a 5 year plan

Typo. Fixed. Ty.

How could the open ending have been presented better

IMO, ""recurrent cyclic themes"" is a stretch for Beren: Next Generations.
That said, you can convey the ""cycle of hatred"" without the sequel bait. Drop the sequel bait, widen the glimpse into the world's response, and leave the peaceful happily-ever-after death's of AOT's cast unanswered.

We do get a conclusion for all of the characters.


Did Reiner ever become the Hero? Did he overcome his regrets?
How does Jean deal with his resentment for Marleyans? 127 is all we got.
What happened with Annie X Armin? It's at the forefront of Annie's story post time skip, and it's non-existent in 139.
What is Gabi and Falco's relationship? Is Gabi the ""Honorary Marleyan"" she strived to be or is she simply an ""Island Devil"" now?
Did Armin ever find peace as Erwin's replacement and Hange's successor?
How will Historia plan to face her new challenges with the world against her?

These questions are critical to primary character arcs and they're left unanswered. Character arcs left to ""presumably"" or ""open ended"" is a huge excuse for bad writing.
All that said, this was a write-up and a half, so I'm 100% not looking to go back and forth with you much more on these points, but I appreciate you sharing your perspective in good faith. Been awhile since I've had all these points broken down and contested in a concise manner. Cheers!

"
27;"EDIT: sorry for the absolute shit formatting btw. It’s late and I’m on mobile as I write this. But yes, nice convo even if we don’t see eye to eye
—-
It’s not outlandish. It’s the truth. All the points were easily explained/countered, as I demonstrated.
—-
It was obvious Ymir had Stockholm. She’s shown envying love by gazing at the married couple. She returns to Fritz after all he’s done to her. It’s obvious, and contradicts literally nothing we already knew about her.
—-
The basis are the several examples I just gave. It’s repeated multiple times, as in the examples I’ve shown. Ymir is enslaved -> Ymir demonstrates an act of quick defiance -> Ymir goes back to being a slave.  
—-
Nothing said Eren could only influence past attack titans. 
—-
Erwin’s death was far more impactful than Connie and Jean turning into titans, so if he randomly came back that’d be tremendously worse.
—-
It was compulsion. It’s repeatedly drives in throughout the series that the Attack Titans intrinsically desire freedom. Freedom is literally the Attack Titan’s whole schtick. To say otherwise is incorrect. That’s the reason the Attack Titian historically caused problems for the Eldian Empire - cuz it was always fighting. Eren admits multiple times he strongly wanted the rumbling no matter how atrocious it was, even if he didn’t know what he did, etc. “everyone’s a slave to something”. Eren’s a slave to his compulsive desire for freedom and we see it throughout the entire series 
Also, you’re misunderstanding me. He didn’t fully understand WHY he had that compulsive desire. Sure, he had additional reasons for the rumbling, but he didn’t understand his underlying compulsion itself. 
—-
Well, I’ll clarify again: we just saw the guy a good little while ago vow to never repeat the same mistakes. We just saw the FT did and all the titans revert. It’s really not that hard for him to believe Armin. It wasn’t “trust me bro”, it was “it makes no sense for us to still be titans”.
—-
It’s not up to interpretation. Isayama decided Historia’s arc was over, so it was over. She had a kid to keep Zeke from being killed and herself from being turned into a Titan and that’s that. Not everything needs to have something big attached to it. Isayama didn’t put any major focus on the child. The fandom was obsessed with it.
—-
Just because Eren didn’t mention it doesn’t mean it isn’t obviously a factor. I once had a mental breakdown, but while my outburst was focused on one thing, the overall breakdown was the result of multiple other factors. Me not mentioning them doesn’t mean someone can come in and say “Nuh uh, you didn’t mention it so clearly if didn’t matter!” And yeah, in a breakdown in a moment of vulnerability and despair he rashly says he doesn’t want Mikasa to move on. Not really outlandish.
—-
My guy, that was just an oversimplification. Every series can be simplified in that way. If you crush AoT up, obviously it just boils down into “war bad”. Fallout does the same thing. But the broader message is that humanity is trapped in a cycle of killing and hatred in which it will never escape. 
People oppress others. The oppressed, rather than turn a new leaf for society, think “well they started it!” and commit the same tragedies to others. While some people will realize the futility in such conflict, mankind as a whole will never escape it. That’s the theme of the story. It’s driven in by the fall of Shiganshina, and the Rumbling. Ymir’s free, and the new tree. Marley’s fall, and Paradis’s eventual fall. We don’t need a panel montage of failing economies and such to drive that point in, because the whole story already did.
And the message is perfectly illustrated just based on the reaction on some in this fanbase desperately try to justify the rumbling, while using the same hypocritical arguments the Marleyan uses. They say Marley killed innocents like Marco, while also advocating for the deaths of folks like Ramzi. They say the outside world’s against Paradis, while advocating for the destruction of Hizuru, Eldia’s allies. They say the yeagerists are protecting Eldia, even though the yeagerists and the rumbling killed millions of Eldians. They say it’s a fight against imperialism and fascism, while the yeagerists violently overthrow the government, kill nearly anyone who even slightly disagrees, and actually fight to reinstate an empire that committed the same atrocities against Marley that Marley is now doing to them. 
—-
I’m sorry but “sequel bait” is incredibly stupid. An open ending is not sequel bait. It’s a clear callback to the cyclic themes. The titan’s return = cycle of war’s return. This is what I mean when I say a lot of the people with issues towards the ending miss out on obvious details.
—-
…Reiner became the hero by stopping a literal apocalypse. We know he overcame his regrets because he’s clearly far happier at the end of 139 - able to be a pervert again and joke around with Jean.
Jean got over it. He remembered Marco’s unjust death. He empathized with the situations of Annie and Reiner. He realized that just like Marco didn’t deserve to die without even talking, the Marleyans didn’t either, no matter what some of their kind may have done.
We don’t need to Armin and Annie have sex or something to infer that they’re pursuing a happier life  together. 
Again. Obvious. Gabi is neither “an honorary marleyan” or an “island devil”. She accepts who she is and realizes that 1) Marley was just using her and 2) there’s nothing wrong with being an Eldian. She’s no longer self-hating or projecting that self-hatred unto others 
We don’t know what Armin may feel in regards to being Erwin’s successor throughout his entire mission for peace, but given his attitude in 139 we can infer through the information Isayama has given us that he’s diligently performing his role.
The way she has since she became Queen: the way best for her, and by proxy, her people. Historia’s not the type to pursue violent bloodshed, but she’s not gonna lie down and let Paradis or her family get fucked over while she’s alive either 
All these questions are ether plainly answered, can be answered based on what we know about the characters, irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, or some combination of the above. 
We don’t need a full dossier on Armin’s life and how he came to view his role in the end, or a bunch of info on what Historia did. We don’t need text boxes to explain Jean’s feelings when we already saw him struggle with Marley and forgive Reiner.

"
28;"Your reasoning on Eren’s mental breakdown was just bad. 
Eren had the conviction to kill around 80% of the population and when the tables are turned he acts like this? Eren is smart enough to know this was a possibility to happen. He faced death numerous times.
Your reasoning could apply to any dying bad guy who loves someone. That’s bad writing.

"
29;"We’ve already seen him breakdown about the rumbling before. It didn’t come out of nowhere nor is it much of a surprise.
Eren has an intrinsic compulsion to cause the rumbling. All his coldness and that shit about being born in this world and wanting revenge is just a coping technique. He cannot resist his desire for freedom, so he chases it endlessly. But his attack titan-amplified compulsion has come to conflict with his human values. 
It’s common for people who struggle with addiction, mental illness, etc. to give into their compulsions, do bad shit, then break down and rant about how “they didn’t want to do it”, because they do AND don’t. Eren is one such person
It’s not “bad writing” for someone to have a mental breakdown after doing something horrible. It’s realistic.

"
30;"
Carla's death is not a plot hole. He used the FT while in the time-fucked realm of Paths to make Dina skip Bert, and push his past self to the path he needed to be on. It's really no different to what he did with Grisha, and nobody complains about that being a plot hole. 

I agree with most of the rest of your comment, but the Carla thing bothers me a lot and imo while your explanation makes sense on the surface, it does not touch on why some people consider it a plot hole.
The issue, I think, is that if Eren could use the Founding Titan to control pure titans in the past, then why didn't he do all sorts of things differently? Why didn't his future self use the FT to activate the Rumbling way earlier? Why didn't he control pure titans to prevent all sorts of tragedies?
You can say ""it's because of determinism, things had to happen a certain way"", but that will never be a satisfying answer. First of all, that kind of pure determinism just makes character decisions feel pointless since it was all predestined anyway. Eren is simultaneously responsible for everything and nothing since it was all bound to happen anyway.
Second, if things were inevitably going to happen a certain way, why did Eren need to intervene to save Bertolt? If Eren's interventions actually matter, then he should have done more of them, if they didn't matter then they're all unnecessary. 
Which bring me to the next issue people have with this plot point. It's totally unnecessary.
Why did we need to know how Bertolt avoided being eaten? That never needed to be an issue in the first place. Isayama chose to create a scenario where Dina walks by Bertolt so he could later tells us Eren was the one controlling Dina there. But why? It adds nothing to the story except the implication that Eren is responsible for his mother's death.
Now, you can say ""well, he needed to be in order to give his younger self motivation"", but the truth is Carla was doomed anyway. Sending Dina that way was irrelevant.
Carla was crushed by flying debris from the wall. She would have just been eaten by some other titan, or died from her wounds. 
There was no reason it had to be Dina. And I have to say, I also just don't personally buy that Eren would do it, as many extreme things as he's done, I cannot see him being responsible for his mother's death as a sensible story development.
And just to be clear, I'm no Eren supporter, I never supported the Rumbling or anything, but I still think that taking the one situation in which he truly was an innocent victim and somehow making him responsible for it was a poor decision on Isayama's part.
Eren didn't need that additional weight on his shoulders, it just kind of adds an additional and unnecessary level of tragedy, and honestly it kind of makes me sick.
It's probably my biggest issue with the ending.
But like I said, for the most part, I agree with the rest of your comment.

"
31;"It's not necessarily determinism. What I mean is that everyone made their choices. They do have the ""free will"" to make choices. Think of it kind of like making a plan for what you want to do for the day. You're sticking to a set of ""predetermined"" actions, but they're still your choices regardless of whether they were planned or not. Not a perfect analogy, but surely you get what I mean.
Also, I'm not saying Eren sent Dina to kill his mom. I'm saying Eren sent Dina away from Bertholt. I should've worded this better in my og comment because it definitely comes off as how ou're taking it. Eren made Dina skip Bert both because Bert had to live and Dina was the one that had to kill Carla. He wasn't deliberately commanding ""Dina, kill Bert"". He commanded her to ignore him.
But I do see your point in it feeling unnecessary. It definitely didn't need to happen, but I'm just making the case that it wasn't a plot hole and helps drive in how Eren's a slave to his own desires. Yeah it's sickening, but that's the point. Eren's a sick person who ultimately would do practically anything to achieve his goals.

"
32;"Bertold had to be eaten by Armin thus he is ignored, Carla must be eaten by Dina so Eren will get traumatized by that pure titan specifically, then he can survive during Clash of titans arc, when Eren and Mikasa gets traumatized by Hannes's death and he uses founding titan's power scream to stop Berthold and Reiner from abducting him or killing anyone of his friends and comrades.
I understand Eren controlling Dina's pure titan feels unnecessary. I agree with you but hope this makes it less sick.

"
33;"well theres 2 sides, one who think this ending was decent because it was a pretty realistic depiction of what should happen. the other camp is one that believes that the ending made the story completely pointless due to the events of the extra chapter, myself included. this side also disliked the somewhat bad writing of controversial characters like annie. the hate is more prominent cause ur more likely to express dissatisfaction online. well theres also a 3rd camp that includes random beliefs like the whole story was about mikasa etc even tho she was sidelined until that one event.
not gonna compare it to GOT since I haven't watched it.
Edit: huge respect for the people keeping the discussion civilized

"
34;"
the other camp is one that believes that the ending made the story completely pointless due to the events of the extra chapter

I still don’t understand this take. Genuinely.

"
35;"Well the bombing that happens anyway in the extra  kinda ruined the whole thing that happened

"
36;"Yea I get that. But it’s not like it happens a week after the story ended. In our world war still happens even though we had the first one. Or the first few. 
For me it hammered home the cycle of violence (which is such an overused trope in my opinion even though I think AoT knocked it out of the park). in this very specific take I don’t get it. Just my thoughts, but I do appreciate the insight regardless.

"
37;"We just wanted to see a better outcome out of all this effort and suffering.
It's more of an ""I don't like the ending but I understand if you do"" kinda thing

"
38;"What better outcome than titans ceasing to exist, the main cast that remained alive got to live long lives and the island itself prospered into modern technology? You are gonna die someday, that doesn't mean that all of what you did is meaningless, this comes directly from Erwin, including ""Humanity will never stop fighting itself until it shrinks to a size of one or fewer"".

"
39;"Accept they show that tree again implying titans will come back

"
40;"My take on this is that the future that Eren saw was his friends living full lives in peace. To him, nothing else mattered.
He paused war for a long time, his friends lived their lives and had families and most likely died from old age. Humanity's fighting cannot be stopped, there will always be people fighting each other, which can be seen in what looks like a few centuries ahead. And for all we know, that last image was likely a few thousand years into the future. Injustice will keep existing and some errors are doomed to be repeated. 
I don't know if Eren saw that much into the future or not, but his goal was never to save humanity. It was to end all titans and save his friends, or at least, most of them (aka Armin & Mikasa).

"
41;"
My take on this is that the future that Eren saw was his friends living full lives in peace. 

Unfortunately, there is a piece of evidence against this, which is on page 9 of the final chapter.
Eren says he didn't even know if his friends would survive the conflict.

"
42;"The existence of titans as a power seemed to be based on what Ymir desired deep down. She was small, weak, afraid, lonely and terrified of death. A giant, impossible to conventionally harm form with abilities that make her useful to the king makes a lot of sense. And her remaining in contact with her descendants even after her death makes sense as well, as she wanted to connect to others and serve her husband (read abuser). It's very fucked up, but it does give a good explanation as to why titan abilities function the way that they do.
This Ymir 2.0 might not have the same wish or drives. So who knows what weird bio powers they are going to get this time.

"
43;"But the centipide made the tree larger 2 times.
So whatever this new bioweapon will be, i’m pretty sure it will be huge too. 
Or maybe it will be the red spider lily from Demon Slayer/s

"
44;"It boosts the tree's growth because it's the source of all life, but what exactly it will do is anyone's guess. If it can create something like the Paths, it could easily go in the direction of psychic powers for example.

"
46;"It implied something new because the Hallucigenia didn't die, but titans are not coming back, they are a big reference to Norse mythology and without Ymir and the tree of paths it doesn't make sense anymore, not mentioning that the titans and paths were exclusively a creation of hers (chapter 137).

"
47;"Maybe they could, but if it was decades removed from the characters of this story why not have a new story of them returning? The new kid who finds it has their own trauma that creates titan or titan like monsters.
There's a lot of ways sequel stories could occur. I'd be interested to see something set during the Great Titan war where maybe the Tybur's are a central character.

"
48;"Wrong, it shows that the primordial source of life, or the source of all organic matter still exists, but what will be created this time will be different.

"
49;"I understand wanting a better outcome for the world and characters, I really do, I get upset at romcoms sometimes. However, in my opinion a better outcome doesn’t seem like it would make sense for the progression of the story or like it would be in any way realistic for the world. Despite all its fantastical elements, the world of Attack on Titan is supposed to be an analogue for our own. I may be a pessimist for saying this, but I think it’s more than likely we as a species will continue to try and wipe eachother out for the rest of time. I think some of the ending is bad in terms of dialogue and pacing, but the actual ending itself in terms of where it takes the story feels like a very natural progression of events. I don’t think it’s the best ending in terms of execution, but to me it feels satisfying overall.

"
50;"Did you guys see the same anime as I did? Those extra chapters basically mean that history will always repeat itself as long as there are humans. That makes sense. 
AoT was always very raw in showing suffering and how the circle of hatred works.

"
51;"The entire point of this Manga is that violence begets violence, and violence can't bring peace. Ending it with a message of, ""and eventually they retaliated, and the wars continued"" is perfectly in-line with the main theme of the story.

"
52;"Last time I checked Japan isn't planning on America's Destruction for Hiroshima and Nagasaki... The whole cycle of violence trope is not only done to death but just plain old stupid...
1st world countries don't engage in warfare at that kind of scale at this point, Economical and Political warfare is much more lucrative to the powers that be... There's a reason the world didn't enter a nuclear winter during the Cold War

"
53;"You are forgetting what happened right after the end of WWII. Yes we nuked them in an attempt to pacify them (and also had the Red Army ready to knock down the door over at Manchuria as well) but we gave them the GARIOA which is essentially the Japanese version of the Marshall Plan and continued to fund the nation for the next four decades to the point than Japan was the 2nd biggest economy at one point. We DID break the cycle of violence because remember, it was Japan that attacked the US first and there was no shortage of support for destroying the whole island as revenge for Pearl Harbor, but instead we only went as far as necessary to end the war (although, there are also some arguments against this too) and once the surrender were issued, we chose peace and mercy instead of enacting revenge

"
54;"That’s just life man. Look at our own world. People have been hating and killing forever and it ain’t gonna stop. You can dedicate your life to trying to forge eternal peace but in the end it won’t have any permanent effect. You’ll just get a Nobel prize if you’re lucky lol.

"
55;"""War will end when there are 1 or fewer humans left"" is a line in the series that got paid off well by that.
The ending gives some solace to the specific characters we've been following, but still sticks to that tone in the end.  Which is a good thing, in my opinion.
Most people aren't like Mr.Braus, nor do they learn and internally reflect like Gabi.  It's a dire ending, but I think it's an important lesson on our collective inability to move past prejudice and hatred.

"
56;"
""War will end when there are 1 or fewer humans left"" is a line in the series that got paid off well by that.

This is not just a line of the series , it's the truth of our world and AoT is not just a fiction , it's a parallel of real world .

but still sticks to that tone in the end. Which is a good thing

Yes .

I think it's an important lesson on our collective inability to move past prejudice and hatred.

This is not the thing , the thing is the AoT is showing us the truth of real world that no matter what the cycle of hatred will always continue .

"
57;"I think you should go back and look at the Gabi storyline. She is pretty clearly set up as foil for Eren and she eventually overcomes the cycle of hatred, which suggests that Eren could have too.

"
58;"Would you say fall of rome made the roman empire pointless? Does the tide at the beach make a sandcastle pointless?
Things go away with time, it doesn't make them pointless.

"
59;">Things go away with time, it doesn't make them pointless.
this is exactly one of the many extensive messages of the whole story imo, and it makes me sad that many people don't seem to realize it. Erwin summarizes it perfectly with his final speech before his dead. {Zeke's conversation with Armin revolves mostly about that too. Those afternoons playing to catch the ball with Tom Ksaver, honoring those before us, Armin enjoying his time with Eren and Mikasa, seeing the beach for the first time...it's all those small moments that gives a sense of purpose to our existence. The nature of time passing by has nothing to do with the value that those experiences can have on us

"
60;"This is such a succinct but eloquent summarization of this point. You’re spot on. There is no ultimate “happy ending” for life—existence, really—because the universe is constantly changing.
I like to think that all our efforts to do good aren’t just for others, anyway—it’s for our own consciences, too. We each have a duty to do the right thing and help others.
The Survey Corps may have not seen the culmination of their efforts and sacrifice, but they did their duty—devoted their hearts—knowing this may be the case. The cast of AoT could never secure peace for all of eternity; that’s simply not possible. That doesn’t mean all they fought for and did win is worthless.
It’s a really important message, and it’s one of the reasons why I don’t mind the ending.

"
61;"I feel like statements like these only work if you assume that the bombings in the extra pages occurred due to war and human nature in general, and not the eldian conflict. We've seen the characters suffer for 3 seasons because of this conflict. All of season 4 was dedicated to characters wanting to solve it one way or another. To end the series off with ""yeah Eldians continued to be despised by a majority of the population for merely existing"", than yeah it's going to be disappointing. All that struggle throughout the series just seems pointless. 
It would be like watching Star Wars, but at the end of return of the jedi, it showed that Palpatine came back 80 years later and continued ruling the Galaxy with his new death star.

"
62;"My interpretation is that AoT is a story about war and the conflict that’s inherent to human nature as told through the lens of the Eldians and world of AoT. So from that perspective, it doesn’t matter if the destruction is directly related to the conflict in AoT or some future issue that arises—Eldians will continue to be despised no matter what, as all populations in the world will be for various reasons, because of the blood thirst and desire for conflict found within human nature.
Believing that the violence in the human spirit can’t ever be overcome is definitely is a pessimistic view, but it’s in keeping with the overarching theme of AoT. Securing peace for all of eternity for Eldians is not possible in the world of AoT (or ours). It’s a bittersweet ending!

"
63;"I mean yeah that’s exactly would happen if An eldian killed 80% of the world’s population and destroyed the same amount of the environment. Even if >! Mikasa, an Eldian, decapitated Eren to stop the rumbling!< it’s incredibly unrealistic to assume the world wouldn’t hold a grudge after they bounced back. The entire point of the series is that war is completely subjective to each side and that it will only end when nobody is left. If there’s anything that actual history teaches us, it’s that conflict is almost always a domino effect and is almost always based on revenge or unnecessary meddling over something else that happened in the past.

"
64;"Isayama in the last chapter put the seeds of a future inner revolt inside the Yeagerist government of Paradis, just as we already saw in the uprising arc or later from the same Yeagerists and so for the series that the History repeat itself. By the way the point is indeed not at all the reason because we attend to another battle at the end, rather that it will be always another battle.

"
65;"Uhh what are yall talking bout when u say 'extra'. I read the manga up to the point where Mikasa thanks eren for the scarf. If there an extra chapter after that or was that the final ending?

"
66;"I think the physical book release had a few extra pages that basically show a montage of the next several decades.

"
67;"Any idea how I can read it? Is it available online?

"
68;"extra pages, AOT, Spoilers

"
69;"Ah thx

"
70;"In addition to the extra pages after ""the scarf scene"" there is also an inclusion in the first part of the last chapter, see the following link: AOT chapter 139 - extra pages - SPOILER

"
71;"Holy crap, I never knew about those extra Ymir pages! Thanks!

"
72;"there was a war decades after mikasa passes (understandable), they lost and ema's hometown was destroyed abandoned but life finds a way as evidenced by the presence of her descendant like a 100 yrs later and he looks alright just taking the dog for a walk. 
the paradis was genocided anyways is a way off the track interpretation of the ending

"
73;"Of course this is all completely objective but for me the extra pages that show us that in the end war destroys paradise makes it even better. 
That's just reality, most things are pointless and have no meaning. Just like in our world. Times change, nations can be at war or peacefully coexist. Our actions in the present influence the future but still the future is uncertain. Old leaders die and new ones will rise in power, the world and the people living in it change and there is probably no action that can guarantee Paradise saftey in the uncertain future. Even if they had found a peaceful diplomatic solution Paradise might have been destroyed in the future.
Just to be clear, this of course does not justify an omnicide. These are just my thoughts on the topic of the peace being temporary and thus pointless.

77;"The world beat Hitler yet Germany still had many nazis in top positions of government, the US hired their scientists, and even to this day they still exist.
Art isn't just meant to entertain you, it's meant to make you think, and I also thought it was pretty entertaining, and a good commentary on the folly of humanity that we will never cease to destroy that which we love and as a whole, a species, are doomed to recreate our own nature, even in spite of heroic people or events that you would think woikd change us for the better.
No amount of progress erases the fundamental biological realities of humanity, but it also doesn't mean we can't keep trying, which was reflected by many characters in the story.
The world doesn't just get better at the end and we all get happy endings. Do you want the show to be a marvel movie? It's so childish, human beings are disgusting, their mortality leads them to commit unspeakable acts. And despite it all we never really learn until it's too late, and always seem to repeat history.

"
78;"Why read the story? Easy, because the story still matters. The story is not pointless because of the ending. After the ending Paradise survived for a few decades but in the far future they were still destroyed. Does the destruction of Paradise make the entire Story pointless? I have to disagree. The Story still took place, the characters lived there live to this point and they took action. Some of the characters survived the ending and continued there journey. My take on the Panel is just that actions taken in the present do not provide certainty about a potential future scenario. And I personally just like that Isayama choose this scenaio that slaps us with that hard hitting reality.

edit. typo

"
79;"It's the journey, not just purely the destination

"
80;"From a certain perspective, existence is pointless. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride.
I feel like the people who didn't like the AoT ending also probably didn't care for the way Mass Effect ended

"
81;"I really dislike when people make assumptions like this. Just lumping people into categories based on one opinion. 
Especially when there’s multiple reasons why some people liked or disliked the ending and they’re not even similar, so why should everyone be put into boxes to begin with?
I feel like that just causes misunderstandings and resentments. 
All this to say, yeah, I personally wasn’t crazy about either ending. But for different reasons. Mass Effect just buckled under its own weight a little and the ending seemed not to be too affected by my actions, which was kind of a bummer.

"
82;"Disagree tbh. I feel like most of the people that hate the ending were bothered by flaws that showed way earlier. Inconsistent character writing, insane amounts of plot armour, cringe details such as mikasa kissing eren's severed head and so on. Ending defenders usually pull the ""you just wanted a disney ending"" card, but a lot of people simply wanted a logical one.

"
83;"Yeah those were concerns but the extra chapter was the nail in the coffin

"
84;"I think the massive over reaction stemmed from how factionalised the community was (and to a degree still is) when the manga was still being written.
As you probably know, SnK attracted a pretty sizeable far right following, who legitimately believed Eren was 100% in the right and that the storys message was pro-ethnonationalist (proof of why schools need to do a better job of teaching reading comprehension). This of course prompted a counter reaction against the hardcore Jaegerists, to whom the story needed to be the ultimate anti-fascist tale in order to follow through on what it had set up and prove those damn Jaegerists wrong.
When the end ultimately had Eren defeated, the Rumbling stopped and Eren himself not even being a true believer in Eldian nationalism the Jaegerist side of the fandom were furious and made a big fuss, naturally. The anti-Jaegerists weren't happy either, since the story kind of says the rumbling was justified because it lead to titan powers going away... somehow... and everyone forgives Eren and so on.
In my mind the real problem was that everyone had become so entwined in serious political conflict that they forgot that SnK is first and foremost entertainment built around amazing action, unravelling cool mysteries and well written character arcs, and from day one has been a bit sloppy with the politics side of things. Everyone convinced themselves that since the story had started dealing with serious themes of nationalism, authoritarianism, bigotry and genocide that Isayama would have something profound to say on that stuff, when that was never what the story excelled at. When is comes to the things it did always excel at the finale has many of the series highest highs and only a few of it's lowest lows.

"
85;"Exactly. It’s the reason why so many of the ending defenders identify as yeagerists. They would have NO, and I truly mean NO problem with the ending if Eren won. Bonus points in their eyes if he got to fuck Historia.
A lot of the ending hate really just boils down into rope not liking that Eren lost. All the other points they bring up are just a way of reaffirming themselves.

"
86;"I liked it. I think it was full circle. Realistically even if eren did eradicate the world. Paradis would eventually destroy itself after some time.

"
87;"While I think you can make this argument especially with Erwin saying humanity will always fight as long as one person stands, I think it would have been far better to not have those ending panels of Paradis getting destroyed. AOT while marked with despair is also filled with the theme of hope. Hope in Armin and Eren to see the outside world, hope in Levi and Hange to carry on their missions past their fallen comrades, hope in Erwin every time he gambled his and his soldiers’ lives in order to gain the advantage, hope for even the Alliance that they could still talk to Eren and stop the Rumbling after all the atrocities he committed. AOT is built upon hope and I think by taking that hope away that the final panels first showed of Reiner and Armin and the rest sailing back to Paradis but this time as peace makers Isayama messed up. 6/10 ending imo but nowhere as bad as people say

"
88;"I think it’s two-fold. First, contrast. Both were absolutely fantastic series, right until the end. When you’re used to something being a consistent 10/10, a single 7/10 feels like a huge drop. Second, in my opinion, the ending is the most important part of your story. Every event, character, and theme in a story can be significantly impacted by the ending. GOT is a great example of this because the ending rendered many events unimportant, ruined certain character arcs, and disregard several of the story’s most profound themes. When you fail to stick the landing, everything that came before may be diminished
Edit: typo

"
89;"In my experience, bigger fandoms attract people with more extreme views, such as hardcore fans and stuff like that, and with the popularity of AoT, it was kind of inevitable for the ending to disappoint a portion of the fandom.
That said, the ending does feel rushed, some dialogue choices were problematic (to say the least), and some choices were not the best (such as Eren being directly responsible for his mother’s death). 
I felt that the last chapter was the weakest part in all of AoT, but I still liked it. I felt that the ending is thematically correct with what the series has been setting up for years. Eren goes to extremes to ensure the freedom of the people he loves, but those people have to stop him from committing mass genocide, because it’s clearly wrong. Mikasa killing Eren was the only right decision, as she finally manages to be free of him, she has loved him so much for so long, and she finally broke free and manages to kill him for the greater good.
Also, a big portion of the fanbase is pro-Rumbling, so the defeat of Eren was something a lot of the fandom didn’t like.
TLDR: It is the part with the most flaws, but the fandom is exaggerating

"
90;"Yeah I like this take. It was always going to disappoint people because of the size of the fanbase, but it definitely was rushed imo.
I saw a take on here that I really liked that was something to the effect of:
Focusing on Eren, Mikasa, and Armin was a good idea for the ending in theory, especially with how they ended up. Eren pulling a Lelouch, Mikasa killing Eren, Armin becoming the savior of the world…but it felt like it came out of nowhere. The trio was very central to the plot in seasons 1-3, but in season 4 it kind of veered away from them and developed other interesting plot lines and relationships, like Eren/Reiner, Eren/Zeke, and Ymir/Historia. Then all of a sudden it loops back around to the original three at the very end without much build up and gives them their ending without quite enough context to make it feel satisfying.

"
91;"Well said. I really think it could have solidified the ending more if we had more EMA time past that table scene. Ever since then they didn’t really interact until the end which took away any real development (including Erens love for her) they could have had before to make the ending land more

"
92;"Because people overhyped AoT in their own heads. There were always holes in the story, there was always some lazy writing, people just chose to ignore it before last chapters. 
Don't get me wrong, I still consider AoT 10/10 masterpiece, but it was never perfect. Because no fictional story is and will never be. Real world is just that complicated.

"
93;"Really? Though I admit aot is not perfect, I didn’t see anything that could be labeled as “lazy writing” until the rumbling happened. Up until that point everything was dare I say perfect. Especially episode 4x20. I don’t think Isayama could have done anything more ground breaking than that. 
If it’s after the rumbling I agree though. Idk if anyone feels the same, but it almost felt like I was watching a marvel movie towards the end. It felt all too generic and predictable/lazy. And the dialogue I wasn’t a fan of.

"
94;"
Eren not being chewed by Santa even tho eating people is the way you can get shifter powers and go back to human, and it is the only time this happens.
Erwin surviving losing an arm (and a shit ton of blood, it got bitten not clean cut), and not only that, but using the maneouver equipment to attack Bert and luckily falling in his horse and escaping.
Eren surviving in S2 finale. The literally only titan that could wake up that previously unknown power (who casually ate her mother by chance) is there. It it were any other titan, they would have died.
Armin surviving heavy burn degrees and a +60 meters fall, for literally an entire episode in which people is discussing. With not even first aid.
Reiner surviving twice in S3P2 with mechanisms not previously shown that are never used again.
Historia reaching increible heights to kill his father remainings, even tho there was no way she could reach it since at that height there were no buildings. They violate basic physics there.

As you see, S2 and S3P2, two of the best rated seasons of the anime, have the biggest plot armor moments. Yet people is complaining the Alliance survived the rumbling...
I think this show is amazingly written. But It has those anime moments and poor writting moments any series has, not only after the rumbling.

"
95;"Not for nothing, in an anime about giant humanoid titans, one has to suspend reality about humans’ ability to survive heavy trauma.

"
96;"But you have to be consistent with it.
How many people died so that they could just fill that hole with a rock?
How many died in the female titans attack? Even the best scouts died during that arc. 
Like 6 people survived after s3 p2s events and realistically armin should have died. 
The titans no matter what titans they are, are extremely strong. 
Then we go to where the alliance fights those zombie titans, how none of them die after seeing so many people die throughout the series is mind blowing.

"
97;"Yeah I agree more characters should’ve died in the finale. I honestly thought Jean and Connie were dead and that Reiner was gonna die by feeding himself to Titan Gabi or something, so it felt kind of cheap when they just transform back and everyone’s fine.

"
98;"No one died in the Kenny fight and the Marley attack either (during the attack not afterwards), and the people surviving all those battles happen to be the main characters, so I would say it was still pretty consistent with its plot armor

102;"People get swallowed by titans all the time tho

"
103;"I'll try to explain these as best I can.

We see in the Titan's stomach that there are other barely alive people contained within. Suggesting that this isn't a rare event. We also see many titans gulp down humans whole throughout the series (such as the titan that faceplants a tower and slurps up a scout earlier in the same episode) without crunching their spines. It's also possible that if Eren died within the Titan's stomach, he would have been digested and the power would be inherited then. It's there for storytelling, sure, but it's not as impossible as you present it.

-This one is kind of iffy, sure, but shock and adrenaline is a powerful thing and the battle did not last too long after that happened. His arm also got bitten clean off, since a titan has teeth the size of a window pane that shut with insane force. And it seems titans don't have molars, but only incisors. The body heat of the titan would also likely make its mouth relatively free of infections.
-This is partially explained in the ending, with Eren editing events to make the smiling titan avoid Berthold and going straight for his house. It's very possible something similar happened here. It's also possible that the smiling titan, being of Royal Blood could sense the coordinate and home in on it, since we know that titans of royal blood don't need sight or smell to locate people (as shown with Rod Reiss when we see through his POV).

The episode took around 20 minutes, not an absurd time to survive with those injuries. He wasn't bleeding so it could be possible, albeit a bit contrived.
The brain-titan brain thing was very weird and out of nowhere I'll give you that. Not sure what the second mechanism you're referring to is though. He was established as being able to withstand the Colossal Titan's explosion beforehand.
That one just seemed like it was there for cinematic purposes truth be told. She could have sliced the chunk when it was closer to the ground, and it wouldn't have changed the story in any meaningful way. Plus we do know that ODM gear can make you ""fly"" for short bursts with just the gas alone if you have enough upwards momentum.

Exactly 💯 .

If it’s after the rumbling I agree though. Idk if anyone feels the same, but it almost felt like I was watching a marvel movie towards the end. It felt all too generic and predictable/lazy. And the dialogue I wasn’t a fan of.

Only a loud minority has this opinion .

predictable/lazy

You are saying that it was so predictable/lazy so it means that you must have predicted some of things , so tell me any one of your predictions .

"
108;"
Because people overhyped AoT in their own heads.

Or just because they just held it to a standard that the manga achieved multiple times before? There's nothing wrong with that.

there was always some lazy writing, people just chose to ignore it before last chapters.

Only until the after the rumbling starting. Before that, there was hardly any flaws that ""people chose to ignore"" lmao.

"
109;"Because in the end there was no twist, Eren had the powers of a god but was a slave to fate, couldn't figure out a plan to save the island, and risked his friends lives (who luckily had plot armor) just to ensure whoever survived lived long lives. Sasha and Hange still died, along with Pixis and the others. Eren even showed his own Mom's death was worth this outcome.
Instead he gave up and cried about Mikasa, then his friends forgave him for the genocide. The cycle of hatred continued and Paradis was carpet bombed. There was no world without walls, only a world without titans - except the power of the titans did not disappear and is likely to return with the final page.
Eren had the power to do anything, but was forced to do it this way because Mikasa needed to free Ymir from her love of King Fritz (who tortured and abused her). Why Mikasa? ""Only Ymir knows"" and that's it. Also Historia's baby didn't matter at all.

"
110;"The biggest twist was that Eren was never going to be free. He was stuck in his fate even though he didn’t want any part of it. He kept moving forward because his goal was to free humanity, mostly his loved ones, from the curse of the titans but as the story moved on it became more evident that Eren was never going to see the freedom he wanted. 
As for the Mikasa part, I think the best way I saw someone explain it was about doing what was right in spite of love. Ymir was trapped in her love for the king to where she was a slave for 2000 years and it was Mika killing Eren that showed Ymir that you can still make the choice to end things even if you are in love.

"
111;"It's not that things are inexplicable, you can explain them using what's in the story. It's a question of is it satisfying or not. Is Eren struggling for 4 straight seasons to be free, only to resign to fate without finding a better solution satisfying? No of course not, doing nothing is always less satisfying than doing something. Giving up is never going to be compelling. 
In fact, some would say its ""The Easy Path"", just like the title of chapter 26. This is where Eren chose to trust his comrades, which resulted in them getting killed. Yet, here in the end he's trusting them yet again - seemingly not learning from Levi Squad being wiped out. Eren did not change, and in the end Paradis was leveled. Eren cried repeatedly about being powerless to change a thing (like chapter 50), and in the end he didn't change a thing. The cycle of hatred continued. I'm sorry, but that kinda blows. 
As far as the Mikasa issue, you can't tell me this didn't feel like it came out of left field. AOT just wasn't a love story, and for it to be THE key to resolving the titan curse (temporarily) was so odd. Especially when it seemed like Eren had freed Ymir just a few chapters prior, so that was also retconned to make Mikasa the savior. Most people went into chapter 139 thinking Ymir was already free, and chapter 139 just said ""actually, she wasn't"".

"
112;"You’re entitled to be dissatisfied but thats just your objective opinion. Eren was never going to be free. His fate was predetermined. He was always going to be the attack titan that caused the rumbling. Idk if there was a better solution with all things considered, not to say genocide was right. Genocide of the Eldians was already happening. 
There was maybe a chance he could have ran away with Mikasa somewhere, but Eren would have died in the next couple of years anyway and then what? Pass down the attack, war hammer, and founding titan to someone else? He didn’t really want that either. This was the only way his friends would ever be free from Titans and it was the best hope that he had to protecting the island. He could save his friends for now and leave it up to them to choose their future and make better choices. To me, that’s something to sit with and each person is going to feel differently about it. 
For Ymir, she was still creating Titans even after the rumbling started. She was just as free as Eren. I think the writing could have done more for why killing Eren, in turn killing the founding titan, broke the curse but it’s not hard to imply it had to do with Ymir being able to witness Eren and Mikasa share a kiss as he dies. Ymir wanted to love an be loved in return and watching Mikasa take her love and kill if was probably what made Ymir ready to move on herself. She was no longer a slave to love at that point. To say attack on titan was never a love story is probably true but that doesnt mean love was never there in the writing. Love being the thing that saves the day, after all the rage and despair we witnessed, is kind of uplifting.

"
113;"Sums up exactly why I hated the ending. Still remembe reading leaks of that crying panel and believing (praying) they were fake lol

"
114;"How did he give up if he continued the rumbling and was able to reach the vision that he saw? He decided to sacrifice himself for his friends but he achieved the thing that motivated him. Also his friends didn’t forgive him necessarily he just died lol it would be weirder if they held harsh feelings towards him. 
The story was never about ending the cycle of hatred we’re pretty much told that that would continue, it would be very unrealistic to think that ending titans and turning the world into our world would create peace forever. 
That is also a huge assumption to think that the power of the titans is returning because of a single panel. Until it is confirmed that’s just headcanon.

"
115;"I would be upset, too, if I got the same messages as you did. So here is my interpretation to the ending. Eren did receive the power of a god, like Ymir did at first. Why didn't Ymir just break free with this power? Not because being a slave by war, because she was chained by her unrequited love to King Fritz, for that she committed great crime and killed endlessly which she deeply regretted but had no way out. Eren just wanted to save the ones he loved at first, but because of his obsession to freedom, to break free no matter what would cost, he was lured by the memory of rumbling in the future, manipulated by Ymir, Eren put the end to the world. Eren was chained to his desire to freedom. For freedom he would do anything, even things he knows clearly wrong, even killing people he knows to be innocent, even risking the lives of people he loves.
In the end, Ymir rested in peace, the world stayed in peace at least for the rest of lives of all Eren's loved ones, and both Mikasa and Armin find happiness. Eren didn't become a mass murderer for nothing. He eradicated TITANS, every single one of them, like he promised on the night of Shiganshina's falling. He did leave a new world of NO WALLS to his friends. Like many Scouts did before, he sacrificed and entrusted hopes to his friends. I think Armin thanked him for that. I also think Historia's baby symbolizes that.
As for the last few panels about the destruction of Paradis in the far future (a hundred years?), that is just reality - the world can't possibly stay in peace forever. The tree and the little boy made me wonder if titans power and all the tragedies are coming back? And I realize this: All theses tragedies are not caused by titans. It was started by humanity's ambitions and greeds, it was by people's obsession when chasing dreams, it was by cruelty of sacrificing without limits.

"
116;"I can't relate to any of the complains at all, except for maybe about the pacing in one part of the final battle. Even on my first read which during which I barely retained the main details and didn't really understand much about why somethings happened I only thought it was underwhelming but I didn't hate it. People comparing it to GoT and Bleach are grossly overstating.
On my second read taking the time to process all the details and with a good idea of the all the themes the ending made complete sense, and I noticed that there's a lot of things people see as plotholes and inconsistencies that are actually intentionally built into the story or have explanations for if you make the effort to remember past information to connect the dots. If you approach the story with bias or are lazy in reexamining text then it is easy to get the wrong idea and run with it, but I really don't think that's the author's problem when he made sure to have everything connect even if it's subtle. And a ton of things have always been subtle and I don't think some readers appreciate the subtlety enough.

"
117;"Because a large chunk of the internet leans towards right wing ideas, such as nationalism, conservatism and imperialism. They consider being cruel is cool and anyone who prioritizes decency or morality over it is childish, which resulted them to be slapped in the faces constantly by the story. They didn’t just suddenly hated the ending, but had been doing it since the Rumbling arc, from lying about the members of the Alliance to defend full blown fascists like the Yeagerists. The ending was just a final nail in the coffin for their hope of Eren successful committing genocide and coming back home as a noble tragic hero. Yams biggest fault is he expected too much maturity and decency from his audiences

"
118;"I think the biggest problem with the ending is that its pretty forced to be this way because of a lack of any real world building post time skip. What did the scouts do for 5 years? Why did they only contact 2 countries? Why did they sit around waiting for destruction until Eren decided to leave, and then still do nothing until they got his letters? It also felt like a bit of a character assassination for eren at the end. Why would he ever kill his own mom? Why is he crying about Mikasa when he neither tried to do anything with her or use his god like powers in a way that guarantees a future with her?

"
119;"Because the author wants you to figure out yourselves. The journey is like walking in a corn maze, really. Not many people want to do that. Some got stuck and thought this is the end. Some just hack the way and make their own ending (laugh).
I don't know about y'all, but it is taking me a LONG time - watching anime 2+ times, reading mangas in two different languages, reading the ending of manga 5+ times, and many hours debating with other fans - to really feel close to understand it. 
To me, I love the journey, I love those ""Ah-ha"" moments. SNK inspires me to think about many things in our life and true world, and I appreciate the messages Isayama conveys to us.

"
120;"Definitely i feel that SnK needs to have a re read when you know that Eren is basically a time traveler.

"
121;"You should rewatch it , you will feel like you're watching it for the first time because you will watch it from an whole other POV and their are uncountable details that you have missed and while re watching/re reading you will notice few of them .

"
122;"SOME people have some (valid) issues with things like the pacing, thinking things needed like, just a chapter or 2 more to fully explain everything or they didn’t like how some characters were handled 
but a lot of people just like to whine because eren didn’t kill literally the entire world, or they’re mad eren and historia didn’t bang, or they’re mad eren wasn’t the gigachad he was faking being the entire time, or they’re basing their arguments off of a bad translation (i saw someone in this very comment section saying eren’s friends “forgave” him for genocide, this is not true and a sentiment that only came from the initial bad fan translation), or they’re upset that paradis got bombed and assume everything was just for nothing and was all pointless when it’s made very explicit that a LOT of time had passed before that happened thus it could have been for any countless number of reasons not necessarily in retaliation for the rumbling and how the cycle of violence/ugliness of humanity and the cruel but beautiful world or whatever is one of the most prominent themes in the series

"
123;"[deleted]

"
124;"Because those arguments themselves are ultimately shallow.

"
125;"That comment would be me.
""Eren, thank you. You become a mass murderer for our sake"" - Armin Arlert (Not a bad translation, go read the actual japanese. The mistranslation was Reiner's ""what a man you are"" which is hilarious.
then everyone cries after talking with Eren like he didn't just kill 80% of the world.
I would bet you'd agree with me that the ending is supposed to show futility and be bleak.. something like human conflict is inevitable. Yet you're taking the most optimistic view of the ending by suggesting even though NOTHING changed, Paradis definitely wasn't bombed out of revenge. You know they were, it is unironically coping to think that things are different this time when 80% of the world is dead lol - its way worse now. Way worse than the past 2000 years of strife. If you don't think the world got its revenge on Paradis you're willingly sidestepping the themes of the story you mention in your own post. The world of AOT is that cruel.

"
126;"and then you conveniently leave out the part where armin calls it a massive error, making the full meaning more accurately “hey i know you did this for us, and i appreciate that and that alone, but this was still a sin of incalculable proportion. however it obviously can’t be undone so i’m going to do what i can”
i mean we literally see in the final chapter that things were changing, the alliance is coming to paradis on behalf of the rest of the world for peace talks. THEY wanted peace with the island and, given the what was presented to us, PARADIS was the one that rejected that offer, and this was presumably a couple years after the rumbling, at least based on how the characters looked and historia’s baby, might be less, but in either case SOME time has passed. maybe not enough for the world to completely recover, but enough time to get back on their feet somewhat and for paradis to recruit and mobilize what looked like a MASSIVE army
given THAT information, at least at the time, when armin and everyone were still alive, the world didn’t want revenge
maybe the people 100+ years later did, but we can’t know that for sure
maybe the world wanted revenge, maybe it was retaliation from paradis going to war with some other nation at that point in the future, or maybe something else, any of those still fit the themes of the story by saying that at SOME POINT, the violence comes back
it’s ambiguous is all i’m saying and saying with CERTAINTY that it’s one thing just seems misguided imo

"
127;"What's your point? I'm not conveniently leaving out anything, it's all there to read.  Eren didn't change a thing and it just ended with them both crying and hugging it out. There is no context that makes that better, Armin straight up thanked him to make him feel better after what he did and then Armin benefitted from the ~80 years where the world was incapable of retaliating. Once they could ~100 years later based on the tech, they did. And we can assume that Armin's kids and Mikasa's kids are either dead or going through hell.
I think you know its unlikely that the outside world just got over it when they didn't get over Eldia's crimes for 2000 straight years. And now Eren made it even worse by killing 80% of humanity. But sure, because someone didn't write out in plain text that it was revenge, I guess it could be something else. You are free to throw away the context of the story if you want. The idea of not burdening future generations with the ""sins of the father"" was a big theme but Eren did exactly that.

"
128;"he thanks eren for thinking of them and wanting a good future for them, but very much so condemns the path he chose, that’s pretty explicit
the reasoning for the world wanting peace could be genuine, could just be to buy time before revenge, we don’t know that for sure, but we see the soldiers at the end choose to believe armin about the titans being gone and not just shooting him on the spot, so i personally tend to believe it’s the latter
what we DO know however is that the world wanted peace and paradis didn’t, that’s explicitly in the text

"
129;"It’s mostly liked people were just too in their head cannon and hung up on less important details that when proven wrong stayed in perma denial about their understanding of the material. Then if you press on it they’ll be more firm in their beliefs which is just a natural human reaction ig

"
130;"I liked it, but I struggled to understand it first time through. Talking about it and watching people discuss it really helped elevate it for me over time. Now, I'm glad it is the way it is, and I wouldn't change it. Truly a one-in-a-million story, beginning to end.

"
131;"It's a classic case of the vocal minority.
I liked the ending and the nuances it brought with it. Loved the story Isayama wanted to tell through Eren.  
I'm okay with anybody else not liking the ending or the show for that matter. It's top tier for me and that's enough. Never felt the need to make a whole post about it here but somehow, the people who ""despised"" the ending constantly feel the need to put their feelings on the sub as posts or comments quite frequently.
I just scroll past those kind of posts

"
132;"Even in this thread you can see most of the people here don’t have much of an issue with the ending, even if they didn’t think it was perfect or amazing.
Obviously the people here aren’t representative of everyone, but like you said, it’s clearly a vocal minority.

"
133;"It's got terrible world building, and an ending that relies on that world building being present.  The story expects us to believe that everyone just forgets 100 years of hatred, and is suddenly willing to treat Eldians like people.  
The scouts wait 3.5 years to even leave the island, when they could've done so as early as 1 year in.  Then they decide to go visit Marley, the country that hates them, to look for allies.  They never visit anywhere else.  Even we don't get to see anything else.  They don't even visit their supposed allies in Hizuru.  Seriously, what does Hizuru actually do to help Paradis?  They promise to find allies, but conveniently that does nowhere.  All of their tech and weapons came from the volunteers.

"
134;"The ending is not widely despised at all. Most people liked it, or atleast thought it was OK. There is a small section of fans who dislike it and are very vocal about it. They even compare it to the GoT ending, which is insane. Best to ignore them.

"
135;"It is definitely superior to GOT season 8

"
136;"Aot was followed for 12 years experiencing a new twist every few chapters. The final arc was just very underwhelming compared to the rest. Eren had literal god power and did nothing with it except kill no-name-characters and die in a pretty meaningless fight and crying about it. Not really a satisfying way to end a giant tragic story like this for most (also fan theories were going crazy even though most of them were utter garbage like the aoe theories)

"
137;"I have the feeling that , when you are waiting for a  chapter every month and following a media for many years then you will somehow always end up disappointed. I had the ""chance"" to read it without having to wait for each new release so maybe that is why my opinion is not severe at all toward the ending

"
138;"Agreed. Anyone who says they weren’t outside their minds when Gabi shot Eren is lying. Maybe it doesn’t land the whole airship exactly the way people wanted, but it was thrilling.

"
139;"Not true. People were hyped and had their expectations blown every month during Marley Arc and Return to Shiganshina Arc. I checked EVERY chapter discussion on this sub during that time and people were praising AoT like crazy. Only during the Rumbling Arc, towards the end, did people feel disappointed because the Manga just didn’t live up to the quality it had before

"
140;"I like the ending tbh! In a world as grim as AoT I would've been extremely disappointed if the ending was all sunshine and rainbows. It was never going to be all of that but ofc people want that for the characters they're so invested in.
After the final chapter there was also a lot of dissatisfaction because of the way Eren suddenly seemed to change/break character. There were a LOT of people that believed he was going to win, so to see him break near the ending wasn't received well by that lot.
However, keep in kind that a LOT of AoT fans just don't discuss AoT online. The part of the fandon that disliked the ending was the vocal minority. And not saying how small or big of a minority because I do not know, but I'm sure the part of the community that was fine with the ending or liked it is at least more than half.

"
141;"vocal minority of whiners

"
142;"Honestly havnt meet many people out side this website that feel it was shit. It’s mostly here you see it.

"
143;"it’s not widely hated

"
144;"I feel it's cause people feel too much in love with the post timeskip Eren, which was more of a mask than anything. People got mad that it was an act.

"
145;"I liked the ending (ish) but I can see why some didn’t like it. Although the extreme backlash was uncalled for. Like some fans did a ‘reanimation’ and it was shite but they thought they ate that

"
146;"There were actually two waves of the whole thing, the first was before the extra pages, and the second after said pages.
The first, I believe was because people wanted Eren, or Paradis, to “win”. They wanted Eren to destroy the world, keeping up with the whole “AOT kills everyone” idea. What people with this view failed to understand was that AOT was actually “realistic” in a sense that it wasn’t “killing everyone” but rather, “letting things happen”. Of course there were protected characters outside the “go with the flow”, but the majority of the deaths, make sense in the world of AOT. The ending solidifies this, the fact the the world is “real”, Armin takes the necessary steps to insure, or try, that the Paradis people begin to be seen as humans, making it a great ending in my opinion.
The second wave, however, is a different story. I for one, don’t understand some of it. The new interaction between Mikasa and Ymir is ok, I don’t think it adds much. The second part, the destruction of Paradis, I think everyone’s problem is the fact that they died anyway, and if Eren got his way, that wouldn’t have happened. I see it in a different way, since we don’t know how many years passed, but at least 100 years passed, the destruction of Paradis wasn’t immediate, time passed, people lived, society lived on, and with it, war lived on. This is the point of AOT, showing that humanity, society, is the problem, Paradis got destroyed because, eventually, everything gets destroyed by humanity, that’s how I see it. But then, comes the last part of the pages, “Beren”. This is the part that I don’t understand, thus disliking. The existence of Beren tells us that everything was meaningless, and now that I put this into words, I start to understand it. People dislike it because they think of the kid as Boruto for Eren, but he’s not, he’s “Boruto for Ymir”. The kid is not a way to continue AOT (I hope), but a way to show that, just like in the real world, humans are bound to repeat the same mistakes.

"
147;"it isn’t. this isn’t the community this is reddit

"
148;"It's not. Titanfolk does not represent the community.

"
149;"I really don’t know I’ve never heard anyone who hates it give any explanation they just use buzz words and say Isayama fell off etc.

"
150;"It's not. It's a small determined minority

"
151;"Personally I didn’t mind the ending. I think everyone just wanted some sort of ending where Eren and Mikasa could live happily ever after, but that simply wasn’t what Isayama had in store for us. I’m very interested in the kid with the dog, I wouldn’t mind a Boruto-type sequel about this kid rediscovering the power of the titans as it appears he’s about to fall into the tree and restart the cycle. This also opens the door to still see Eren, since Attack Titan hosts can interact with past and future hosts, so if they go this route we could see more of Eren.

"
152;"The ending was great. I think that just like with any other massive franchise the vocal minority is the loudest group. 
Also to be fair the ending was super rushed. That is pretty obvious.

"
153;"I hated it at first. I really didnt get it all cause the story was so confusing. Now that the dust has settled and people have made sense of it, I can really appreciate what Iseyama was going for.

"
154;"People were so behind the idea of Eren killing everyone that they hate the idea that Eren didn't want to commit genocide and actually wanted to live a happy life with Mikasa.

"
155;"The ending is bad cause alliance defeats all the ancient titans, like they were pockemons. Dialogues are stupid, Eren’s speech “I don’t know what the hell i was doing” is confusing, “it all was for Mikasa to make her choice” is confusing again. Finally, Armin’s words “they will see us together and would want to hear our story” is too naive for all the AoT journey. 
Long story short - the ending is bad cause it is to childish for the story we were watching for ten years at least

"
156;"ending isn't widely despised, just the people who don't like it don't shut the fuck up about it

"
157;"[deleted]

"
158;"
widely despised

Uh....no? The ending is agreed upon by the wide majority of the community to be quite good. The hateful minority is just loud.

"
159;"Why do people on Reddit live inside such a bubble to think that ""everyone despises the ending"" when in reality is almost the opposite?

"
160;"Facts 💯 .

"
161;"I don’t think it’s widely despised. But those who don’t like it is maybe because it didn’t meet their expectations. It seems a majority of those who read the ending after some time it was released or didn’t have any theories or ideas in mind of how it would end, received it better.

"
162;"it's not

"
163;"It's not widely despised at all. Most people like it or think it's passable. It's just that the minority who don't like it are extremely vocal.

"
164;"Astoundingly vocal

"
165;"I don’t get why the extra chapters and paradis getting bombed matters. Eren’s goal was for his friends to live long lives and he achieved that. What happens to paradis years later is irrelevant to him

"
166;"Correction: it is not widely hated.
It is mostly hated by a LOUD MINORITY
They wanted an ending where Eren would kill his friends, get married to Historia and raise kids together

"
167;"Sounds shitty ending to be honest

"
168;"Unfortenately, a lot of answers you have in this thread are not answers from people disliking the ending, but rather people trying to explain to you why others disliked it. Be careful when reading those, as most of the time, they are wrong because they'll only respond with their biases.
The answer you got here is a perfect example of that, as it definitely does not make unanimity among people who disliked the ending AT ALL. Some wanted that ending, it's true. But that's just it, some.

"
169;"It's almost certainly not 'widely'. Compared to all the enormity of everyone who read the ending, they're a small group, just really loud.

"
170;"I don't think it is, there was just a lot of initial backlash. I feel like it's been normalized as ranging from anywhere between bad and good these days. But neither horrible nor excellent.

"
171;"Fascists get mad when they're reminded they always lose.

"
172;"It was a slap in the face to what made the story so gripping and compelling in the first place. Characters go from having nuance and purpose to one dimensional fan service characters. A lot of the main themes that the show was trying to tackle were just forgotten about.

"
173;"Been saying for the longest time that the anime will be digested far better than the manga was. The hype of events to come will trump the disappointment of not getting a better ending. Like you said, the ending was OK, not great, and not bad. Definitely not GoT season 8 bad (anyone saying this is going to look so stupid when there isn’t as much hate for the ending as they wanted). It’s already happening. Manga readers were already jumping ship by now and currently most anime onlies are loving the end.

"
174;"The ending haters are just a loud minority and the ending is not just ok it's a very good ending .

"
175;"Mikasa kissing a decapitated head

"
176;"Firstly, because it kinda makes the whole story pointless. the outside world was going to destroy paradis anyways, but eren fought and did everything he did to kill 80% of the population in the outside world… for the same result. paradis gets destroyed anyways as seen in the extra pages. the 80% of people wiped out died for little to no reason.
second, it wasn’t realistic at all. and i know we’re talking about a series where people transform into giants, but i’m talking about the plot armor. in the final battle it was a few shifters and a few soldiers with odm gear vs dozens if not hundreds of the past shifters, and i think only Hange died, where without an insane amount of plot armor, they would have been slaughtered very quickly. not to mention kruger and grisha’s shifters coming to fight even though they did what they did when they were alive to restore eldia, and now they come back to fight to make sure eldia gets destroyed.

"
177;"Jean deserved better

"
178;"very vocal minority, bruh..

"
179;"Because of their non-existent ability to comprehend what they read or to understand themes and the simple fact that what THEY personally want to happen not happening does not equal poor writing. You can generally put the people who don’t like the ending into one of, a combination of, or all of said categories.

"
180;"It’s such a braindead take to say that people who disagree with you about liking the ending have reading comprehension issues.

"
181;"Yet they would say the same about you :) there are definitely valid reasonings as to why A Lot of people dont like the ending

"
182;"Meh. It’s all miscomprehension. Like for instance, armin nor any of the alliance are okay with Eren’s genocide. What Armin was saying is that even though Eren did an unforgivable thing, it does give paradis a chance to bargain from a position of strength with what remained of the world and they aren’t just gonna squander that chance because of what caused it being wrong. Likewise, he and Mikasa have known eren since childhood. Idk if you’ve ever had a family member do something fucked up but you still love them and care for them. You’ll have mixed feelings trying to reconcile how you feel about them vs their horrible actions. 
Also, people complaining about the alliance don’t seem to realize that enemies put aside their differences all the time and work together. Especially in storytelling. Most of them had known each other for a very long time again they would have mixed messy complicated feelings about each other and it makes Perfect sense to me that with the rumbling have decimated almost all the world and they all just wanted peace at that point after a lifetime of conflict. 
Eren letting Dina’s Titan past bertholt is harder to reconcile I’ll admit but from what I understand Eren knew that bertholt had to survive for him to be able to do the rumbling and so he let him past. The exact circumstances had to happen for Eren to get where he was.

"
183;"your nitpicking three points of an ending that consisted of many many more elements. i thought the ending was fine, but saying EVERYONE who didnt like the ending “misunderstood” it is a far stretch, and no matter how much you want to think AOT’s ending was some extremely nuanced and hard to understand ending, it simply isnt, and just because someone doesnt like something doesnt mean they don’t understand it. youre not above everyone and your reading comprehension isnt better than everyone because you like AOT’s ending.

"
184;"I don’t think it’s nuanced I thought it was aight. I legitimately just think (from what I’ve seen of people’s arguments online) is that they speed read the ending (or was using a shitty fan translation) and then watched a bunch of YouTube videos on how the ending sucks. It’s annoying when most of people’s problems are easily explainable, most of the answers can be found right in the manga they just wanna misunderstand.

"
185;"You come off really pretentious when you assume that only you have the right understanding of themes as if it doesn't boil down to being subjective. Drowning out criticism because you think people just didn't get it is cringe.

"
186;"I don’t assume I’m the only one rightly interpreting the story. I’m saying that a lot of the criticisms are invalid because they aren’t true. Again, like the claims I talked about above. You don’t have to like the ending, but lying about the story to justify it is dumb. You just didn’t like it, so own it. For whatever reason you didn’t like ending it isn’t due to the story being bad, it’s due to preferences.

"
187;"Well AOT is not rocket science or anything that you need an ultra superior brain to comprehend. 
Just becuz you like the ending and others don't, it doesn't mean the other side are all illiterates.

"
188;"I just never said it did, I’m an average Joe that’s what it amazes me that you have people claiming things that are contradicted by the manga and anime.

"
189;"Because most seem to forget that it is a Shonen.

"
190;"Bc it’s sad and people don’t understand how hard it is to end such a show and keep everyone happy. Reactions to ending is only bad in the US

"
191;"Oh that’s actually really simple, because it’s dreadful!

"
192;"Although SNK is quite good for Isayama's first manga, you can tell from the first few seasons that it has weak points, and in my opinion the most obvious example is the characters. But it worked because the plot was simple but captivating, a culture surrounded by walls that protect them against titans and a group of young people willing to give their lives to kill them all, especially a violent young man named Eren. However, what fans loved were action scenes, which is why Levi is so beloved despite being a bit flat as a character. The moment it swings between trees or buildings chasing its prey is one of the most epic things out there, and the animation and soundtrack contribute greatly to that.
Discovering what mystery was hidden beyond the walls was the common thread of the series.
However SNK stopped working when it opted for a more complex plot. I mean after the episode on the beach. Then Isayama's writing weaknesses were more apparent. It is evident that this sudden plot complexity was the result of Isayama's philosophical musings, but he did not know how to incorporate them well into the story. I also think it shows when a writer prepares an ending in advance and when is hesitant about which option to take.
Finishing a complex plot is difficult, but it can be done well if you are a very good writer.

194;"I hate it because it makes no fucking sense you’re telling me the rest of the world was able to destroy paradis who was untouched by the rumbling? The rest of the world was fucking flattened and burned 80% of the world(wether that be population or land) is a metric shit ton apocalypse levels of death and destruction. There is no conceivable way Paradis the only intact nation and the unrivaled super power at the end of the series was destroyed by the exterior world which was dealing with massive demographic societal and economic collapse.
