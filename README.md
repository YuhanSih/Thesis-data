# Thesis-data

This repository contains the data and methods planned for the thesis, as well as the pilot study to process the data. I intend to conduct topic modeling and sentiment analysis on Reddit comments. For the sentiment analysis, I first utilized NLTK Vader to analyze the sentiment of each comment, and then I employed Riveter to ascertain the sentiment towards certain entities. The sample data comprises comments under the Reddit post titled "Why is the ending so widely despised by the community?"
